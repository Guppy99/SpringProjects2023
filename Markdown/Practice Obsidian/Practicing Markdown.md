    I learned a lot about how best to use markdown and obsidian to organize files in a different way than I normally would. I like the idea of having the web graph structure thing to see how things connect and how they relate to each other, I think it could be useful when starting a project out to perhaps storyboard and jot down ideas for a project and then later see how your research, notes, ideas, thoughts, beatboards, etc. all connect. I don't know how complicated it would get seeing how your web graph was very complex I'm not sure if my brain would comprehend it at first but being able to filter it by tags might help narrow it down further. It will probably take me a while to get used to it, but I think it has a lot of potential.
